    "reasoning": "Successfully applied Vercel React Native Skills (https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills) to the ALIAS Executive Agent project. Applied rules across 8 categories: (1) Core Rendering (CRITICAL) - Fixed Rule 1.1 (falsy && operators) in 6+ files to prevent production crashes with empty strings. Fixed Rule 1.2 (strings in Text) verified all text properly wrapped. (2) List Performance (HIGH) - Rule 2.1 verified no inline objects in renderItem patterns. Rule 2.6 verified proper key usage. Rule 4.1 confirmed no scroll position tracking in useState. (3) Animation (HIGH) - Verified proper use of transform/opacity animations. (4) Navigation (HIGH) - Using native stack navigators. (5) UI Patterns (MEDIUM) - Rule 9.5: Replaced react-native Image with expo-image@55.0.3 in Avatar.tsx and ChatInput.tsx for better caching and performance. Rule 9.9: Replaced all TouchableOpacity with Pressable in Button.tsx, Header.tsx, ChatInput.tsx for cross-platform consistency and active state support via active:opacity classes. (6) State Management (MEDIUM) - Verified proper state patterns. (7) React Compiler (MEDIUM) - Code is compatible with React Compiler. (8) Configuration (LOW) - Using proper config plugins. All changes follow Expo SDK 55 best practices and improve performance, reliability, and maintainability.",
